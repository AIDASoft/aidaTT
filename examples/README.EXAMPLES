These examples are work in progress.

They demonstrate different working subtasks of the tracking toolkit.
To build them, yopu need to a working installation of 
	[DD4hep] [GBL] [LCIO]

[geometry_test]
Simply shows that a surface geometry can be read in and accessed in all its elements.
Needs a compact xml description, e.g. the xml files included in the directory.

[intersection_calculator]
Is one step up from the simply reading of the geometry.
All intersections with a given reference trajectory are calculated; testing both geometry and toolkit functionality.
Needs a compact xml description, e.g. the xml files in the directory.

[lcio_read_example]
One step further -- reading in a geometry and some lcio data, which consists of simulated hits.
The data was produced within a DD4hep example and is available in the directory; along with the compact xml description.

[gbl_example]
Is the first showcase of a complete fitting chain: read in a detector description (again a compact.xml file) and some data produced with the DD4hep example simulation.
The data is read in and fitted with the GBL; at the end the results are printed.
All needed data is provided within the example directory.
