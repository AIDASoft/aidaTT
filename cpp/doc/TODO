FINDING versus FITTING

fundamental question:
	fitting is well defined:
		- measurements: coordinates + errors
		- material 
		- initial parameters
	
	finding is not:
		- look for "next" hit




* rethink & rework Measurement surfaces & geometry interaction:

fundamental question(s):
	- propagateTo 
	
Info:
	try to implement material integration along a track with gear
	+++>>> time estimate on how long this takes 
		?? how to disentagle look-up time? ?

two approaches
  1) "mine" --  do it constructively
	hold the geometry in memory; have a navigator (TGeo-like) to follow
	
	
	
	

CMS approach: 
 (1) local patrec (CTF): layered geometry
	a: find layers along seed trajectory
	b: find compatible detectors in layer
	c: find compatible measurements in detector




basically everything:
    - write simple test programs
    - simple simulations
    - define functionality
    - unit tests & test system
    - update documentation
